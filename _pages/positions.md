<h2>Postdoctoral Researcher: Viral Host-Pathogen Interactions and Cell Biology</h2>

<h3>ROLE:</h3>
The postdoctoral researcher will study intracellular viral infection by employing prototype and cutting-edge optical tools, to both image and optically manipulate samples. The post-holder will be hosted by the Henriques lab at IGC, with an opportunity of short visits to the large network of laboratory collaborators.  

<h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
Applicants should have a BSc and PhD (taken in the last 3 years) in a relevant field and extensive research experience in cell biology, virology, host-pathogen interaction and imaging. Experience in HIV-1, super-resolution microscopy, structural biology, biophysics and computational modelling will be valued. Good communication skills, including a good level of spoken English to enable a good communication and work in an international setting, are necessary. High commitment and a collaborative attitude are needed for this job.

<h2>Postdoctoral Researcher: Optical and Computational Biophysics</h2>

<h3>ROLE:</h3>
The postdoctoral researcher will develop and use optical, computational and biomedical approaches to explore the integration of automated and intelligent super-resolution
microscopy into large image-based infection assays. The post-holder will be hosted by the Henriques lab at IGC with an opportunity of short visits to the large network of collaborators the laboratory holds.
