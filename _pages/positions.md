We are currently looking for researchers to join our new laboratory at <b><u><a href="https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/">Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia</a></u></b>:

<h2>Postdoctoral Researcher: Viral Host-Pathogen Interactions and Cell Biology</h2>

<h3>ROLE:</h3>
The postdoctoral researcher will study intracellular viral infection by employing prototype and cutting-edge optical tools, to both image and optically manipulate samples. The post-holder will be hosted by the Henriques lab at IGC, with an opportunity of short visits to the large network of laboratory collaborators.  

<h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
Applicants should have a BSc and PhD (taken in the last 3 years) in a relevant field and extensive research experience in cell biology, virology, host-pathogen interaction and imaging. Experience in HIV-1, super-resolution microscopy, structural biology, biophysics and computational modelling will be valued. Good communication skills, including a good level of spoken English to enable a good communication and work in an international setting, are necessary. High commitment and a collaborative attitude are needed for this job.
