We are currently looking for researchers to join our new laboratory at <b><u><a href="https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/">Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia</a></u></b>:

<h2>Postdoctoral Researcher: Unveiling live-cell viral replication at the nanoscale
</h2>

<h3>ROLE:</h3>
The post-doctorate researcher will work closely with experimental researchers in the laboratory of Prof. Ricardo Henriques to conceive the ideal design for studies of viral infection with HIV-1 using super-resolution microscopy. The project involves establishing viral infection assays and the analysis of the viral entry process in cells. The aim is to explore new prototyped technology in the laboratory to understand how the viral entry process is linked to replication efficiency.

<h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
Applicants should have a BSc and PhD (taken in the last 3 years) in a relevant field and extensive research experience in cell biology, virology, host-pathogen interaction and imaging. Good knowledge of spoken and written English (essential). The desired candidate should have experience in virology and cell biology (ideally from a virology laboratory). The candidate must be familiar with the production and purification of the HIV-1 viral particles.
