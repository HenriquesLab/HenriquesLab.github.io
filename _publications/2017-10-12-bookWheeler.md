<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Super-resolution microscopy depends on steps that can contribute to the formation of image artifacts, leading to misinterpretation of biological information. We present NanoJ-SQUIRREL, an ImageJ-based analytical approach that provides quantitative assessment of super-resolution image quality. By comparing diffraction-limited images and super-resolution equivalents of the same acquisition volume, this approach generates a quantitative map of super-resolution defects and can guide researchers in optimizing imaging parameters.
