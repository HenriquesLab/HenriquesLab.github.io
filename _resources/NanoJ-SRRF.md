SRRF (pronounced as surf) is as a novel open-source and high-performance analytical approach for Live-cell Super-Resolution Microscopy, provided as a fast GPU-enabled ImageJ plugin. SRRF is capable of extracting high-fidelity super-resolution information in modern microscopes (TIRF, widefield and confocals) using conventional fluorophores such as GFP. Compared to other methods, SRRF is capable of live-cell imaging over timescales ranging from minutes to hours, using sample illumination orders of magnitude lower than methods such as PALM, STORM or STED.
