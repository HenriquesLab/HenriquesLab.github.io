This is a MicroManager hardware autofocus plugin, used in Whitley et al bioRxiv 2020, developed between the Henriques and Holden laboratories. This plugin will perform microscopy autofocus while imaging a sample with visible fluorescence light, using the cross correlated signal from infrared brightfield microscopy running independently on a second camera, based on the principle described in McGorty et al, Optical Nanoscopy 2013.
