SQUIRREL is an analytical approach for quantifying image quality in super-resolution microscopy, provided as a GPU-enabled open-source ImageJ plugin. SQUIRREL requires two input images - a super-resolution image (or image stack) and the diffraction-limited equivalent of the same imaging volume. It then calculates an error-map, highlighting areas of the super-resolution image which exhibit poor agreement with the diffraction-limited image, and quality metrics for the super-resolution image.
