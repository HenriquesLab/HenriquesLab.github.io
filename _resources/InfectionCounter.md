This approach uses images of cells that have been labelled for viral antigen and cellular nuclei using DAPI; the plugin first approximates the location of each cell using the nuclei then scores them as positive or negative for viral antigen. It's a simple analysis, but very robust. By exploiting the plate-reading capabilities of our microscope we can easily image and quantify hundreds of samples every week with relatively little effort. A significant improvement on me, feeling sick, clicking away on a tally counter for hours upon end.

We recently published a description of Infection Counter in Viruses, where we give a detailed account of how it works and provide data to validate the technique. The plugin is free to download so we encourage y'all to give it go on your virus of choice.
